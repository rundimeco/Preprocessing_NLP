The objective of this course is to evaluate the influence of ``preprocessing`` in NLP by first focusing on text classification and a classical Machine Learning Pipeline.

This repository contains :

- These slides (PDF) in French and English
- A simple notebook illustrating multi-class classification:
  - `01_run_experiments_simple_task.ipynb` (Kaggle dataset)
- Another example based on a well-known multilingual dataset:
  - `corpus_multi.zip`
  - `02_DiagLang.ipynb`
- We then experiment with a different dataset:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/multi-task-learning
  - `03_Sentiment_analysis.ipynb`
- The objective is to compare different classifiers and to understand:
  - which preprocessing steps are the most effective
  - how preprocessing effectiveness depends on the classifier
  - how it depends on the task, the type of text, and the language ...
